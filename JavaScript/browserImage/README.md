## Overview

The application is an example on how to use the image compression library on the webcam stream. 


## Algorithm
Image compression operates on encoder-decoder architecture. The following figure illustrates this model.

As evident from the above figure, the model clusters the data into lower space in the encoder side and on the decoder side, the cluster is interpreted and decoded accordingly. The algorithm for compression is K-d Trees (K-dimensional Trees).
